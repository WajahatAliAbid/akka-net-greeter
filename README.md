# Akka .net Core Greeter
## Introduction
Akka.NET is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on .NET & Mono. It's a port of Akka framework originally written in Java/Scala. Akka.net is the implementation of Actor mode. 

> The Actor Model provides a higher level of abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed systems. It alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent and parallel systems.

This project is basic actor model implementation which prints messages in upper case sent by our system. 

To run the project, use the following command

```bash
dotnet run -p ./src/AkkaNet.Demo/AkkaNet.Demo.csproj
```
